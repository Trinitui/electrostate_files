      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;video-game-roundup&#34;&gt;Video Game Roundup&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a view of the games I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing recently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;europa-universalis-v&#34;&gt;Europa Universalis V&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They finally made a decent followup to Vicky 2, and put it in a nearly over-designed game. Love it, love playing it, love not know what the heck is going on, and love that these are the early days and more content is coming. This is a wonderful game on it&amp;rsquo;s own, and a fantastic foundation for future content.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a view of the games I&rsquo;ve been playing recently.</p>
<h3 id="europa-universalis-v">Europa Universalis V</h3>
<p>They finally made a decent followup to Vicky 2, and put it in a nearly over-designed game. Love it, love playing it, love not know what the heck is going on, and love that these are the early days and more content is coming. This is a wonderful game on it&rsquo;s own, and a fantastic foundation for future content.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that they answered the question of &ldquo;What could you possibly do after 12 years of EU4 and it&rsquo;s updates&rdquo; with a pretty amazing response - take the bones of EU4 but make it a deeper simulation, and in so doing add mechanics and features that alow the game to grow laterally. Pretty clever stuff. BUT - I wonder how much longer Paradox can keep this up?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been exploring the game with these nations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Holland</li>
<li>Livonian Order</li>
<li>Egypt</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the strengths of EU5 is that it takes the flavor and interesting mechanics/elements that you can find not playing in Europe from EU4 - this is a huge change from when EU4 went live and Europe was the focus.</p>
<p>Another strength is that playing a small nation is fun! You can literally build it up from scratch!</p>
<h3 id="wall-world-2">Wall World 2</h3>
<p>Games like this are awesome to find. You need to play so many subpar or just ok games to find the indie game like this that really hits in a unique way.</p>
<p>On it&rsquo;s surface, it&rsquo;s a dome keeper clone, but that comparison only goes so far. There&rsquo;s a story, there&rsquo;s story missions, and a more meaningful upgrade path than dome keeper has. This is yet another hit for the &ldquo;games with yellow as an accent color&rdquo; category in 2025 (after Citizen Sleeper 2).</p>
<h3 id="coal-llc">Coal LLC</h3>
<p>What if indie games were just flash games???</p>
<h3 id="openttd">OpenTTD</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been fooling around with different scenarios and ideas, but nothing has really caught me at this point.</p>
<h3 id="openfrontio">OpenFront.io</h3>
<p>In my mind this is a flash game, even though it really isn&rsquo;t. This is a flash game take on Risk, it&rsquo;s fun and arcadey and hits a weird &ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;strategy&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo; game itch that you need sometimes. Sometime you just need a trashy game to spend time with, and this has been that.</p>
<h3 id="battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</h3>
<p>Been playing this on and off, but it can be hard to find time to devote to this with so much other good stuff out there</p>

      <title>Video Game Roundup Late October 2025</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;video-game-roundup&#34;&gt;Video Game Roundup&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a view of the games I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing recently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;battlefield-6&#34;&gt;Battlefield 6&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I try to dip into this when I can. While I&amp;rsquo;m not happy with the state of AAA games, my one exception is the Battlefield series. I&amp;rsquo;ve been hooked since I played 3 back in 2013 and though I haven&amp;rsquo;t played all since that released, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to dip in when I can. I think 2042 ended up in a cool place when I re-visited it this year, and 6 is legitimately good. Excited to play more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h3 id="ascension-deckbuilding-game">Ascension Deckbuilding Game</h3>
<p>Ascension used to be me and my friend&rsquo;s go-to game back in College. Now, I&rsquo;m having a ton of fun playing it digitally. While I want to play with other people, I haven&rsquo;t really found a group that wants to play it as much as I do. For now, this version of it is enough.</p>
<h3 id="openttd">OpenTTD</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m back on it again. I feel like when I finally got into this game late last year some unholy seal had been breached and my life would never be the same again. Like when you play Minecraft for the first time. I&rsquo;m high on the scenarios this time - playing a Middle Earth one (very cool) and one based on MA (even cooler) and I&rsquo;m having a blast.</p>
<h4 id="dipping-into">Dipping into</h4>
<ol>
<li>Mars Logisitcs - this is a fun lego-type game that I need to put more time into</li>
<li>Anno 1800 - What a beautiful, overwrought thing they created here. I need to simultaneously play Victoria 3 and sip London Fog tea.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h4>
<ol>
<li>EU5&hellip;</li>
