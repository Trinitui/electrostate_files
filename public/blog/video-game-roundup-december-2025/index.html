Here&rsquo;s a view of the games I&rsquo;ve been playing recently.
KOTOR 2
I mainlined this game in early december. Beat it in a week. It&rsquo;s a weird, broken thing - but fun! Playing it again.
KOTOR 1
After failing to get into it in 2024, I&rsquo;ve become addicted this month. Playing on Switch. Beat it before the end of the month, and boy does the light side ending just not hit right. That whole game is/can be deeper than it lets on." />

<p>Here&rsquo;s a view of the games I&rsquo;ve been playing recently.</p>
<h3 id="kotor-2">KOTOR 2</h3>
<p>I mainlined this game in early december. Beat it in a week. It&rsquo;s a weird, broken thing - but fun! Playing it again.</p>
<h3 id="kotor-1">KOTOR 1</h3>
<p>After failing to get into it in 2024, I&rsquo;ve become addicted this month. Playing on Switch. Beat it before the end of the month, and boy does the light side ending just not hit right. That whole game is/can be deeper than it lets on.</p>
<h3 id="stonks-9800">Stonks 9800</h3>
<p>Got really into this, and now I&rsquo;m very rich in game! But now it&rsquo;s the &rsquo;90s and the economy sucks, so I tihnk I&rsquo;ll stop playing until 1.0 hits.</p>
<h3 id="mars-horizon-1">Mars Horizon 1</h3>
<p>Kinda turn based, space agency style game - fun. Want to put more time into it.</p>
<h3 id="nuclear-throne">Nuclear Throne???</h3>
<p>The GOAT has returned, and more powerful than ever. Nuclear Throne is such an iconic 2010&rsquo;s indie game, glad it got update 100 and there is a bit more buzz around it.</p>
<h3 id="battlefront-classic-collection">Battlefront Classic Collection</h3>
<p>Flawed but playing on Switch. Kinda cool to be playing these games on a console again, they work much better with a controller. I&rsquo;ll futz with it for a while, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
