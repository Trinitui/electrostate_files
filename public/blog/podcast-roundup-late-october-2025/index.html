<p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to this one for maybe almost six months? It&rsquo;s a good show for commuting, and I always like hearing people explain why they are passionate about different games. It&rsquo;s rare that a game that came out in the past 10 years is covered, so it&rsquo;s good to hear about obscure games and their stories.</p>
<h3 id="side-story">Side Story</h3>
<p>Austin Walker&rsquo;s new pod. About games. He&rsquo;s a great personality and hearing him talk about games again is great. I don&rsquo;t listen religously, but when it pops up in my feed and I have time, I listen in. It&rsquo;s chill, and they talk about games that I don&rsquo;t usually play, so it&rsquo;s a great time.</p>
<h3 id="a-more-civilized-age">A More Civilized Age</h3>
<p>This pod was my entry drug back into podcasts. I listen to podcasts all the time because of this show - finding it in 2023 was like discovering a whole new world. Their current unit on KOTOR II I&rsquo;m not really feeling - I should have played the game alongside them but didn&rsquo;t - but I&rsquo;ll dip in more in the future when their unit changes. Excited to see what comes next from this show.</p>
<h3 id="tapcaf-transmissions">Tapcaf Transmissions</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t listen to new ep&rsquo;s, but I do listen to their older shows on EU Star War books when I finish those books. They aren&rsquo;t the best at recapping books, but it&rsquo;s still entertaining.</p>
