      <title>Video Game Roundup Late October 2025</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;video-game-roundup&#34;&gt;Video Game Roundup&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a view of the games I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing recently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;battlefield-6&#34;&gt;Battlefield 6&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I try to dip into this when I can. While I&amp;rsquo;m not happy with the state of AAA games, my one exception is the Battlefield series. I&amp;rsquo;ve been hooked since I played 3 back in 2013 and though I haven&amp;rsquo;t played all since that released, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to dip in when I can. I think 2042 ended up in a cool place when I re-visited it this year, and 6 is legitimately good. Excited to play more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a view of the games I&rsquo;ve been playing recently.</p>
<h3 id="battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</h3>
<p>I try to dip into this when I can. While I&rsquo;m not happy with the state of AAA games, my one exception is the Battlefield series. I&rsquo;ve been hooked since I played 3 back in 2013 and though I haven&rsquo;t played all since that released, I&rsquo;ve tried to dip in when I can. I think 2042 ended up in a cool place when I re-visited it this year, and 6 is legitimately good. Excited to play more.</p>
<h3 id="ascension-deckbuilding-game">Ascension Deckbuilding Game</h3>
<p>Ascension used to be me and my friend&rsquo;s go-to game back in College. Now, I&rsquo;m having a ton of fun playing it digitally. While I want to play with other people, I haven&rsquo;t really found a group that wants to play it as much as I do. For now, this version of it is enough.</p>
<h3 id="openttd">OpenTTD</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m back on it again. I feel like when I finally got into this game late last year some unholy seal had been breached and my life would never be the same again. Like when you play Minecraft for the first time. I&rsquo;m high on the scenarios this time - playing a Middle Earth one (very cool) and one based on MA (even cooler) and I&rsquo;m having a blast.</p>
<h4 id="dipping-into">Dipping into</h4>
<ol>
<li>Mars Logisitcs - this is a fun lego-type game that I need to put more time into</li>
<li>Anno 1800 - What a beautiful, overwrought thing they created here. I need to simultaneously play Victoria 3 and sip London Fog tea.</li>
</ol>

      <title>Solar Dreams</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-sun-shines-everywhere&#34;&gt;The Sun Shines Everywhere&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of solar around me. By that, I mean take a look at a new country-club type place in town that the town is generating energy off of. It&amp;rsquo;s been installed for over a year and the combo of solar power and batteries has really brought down costs in Medfield.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59552faaff7c50fb8b38c931/15436b60-9522-41a7-921a-2de429bd3826/DJI_0868.JPG?format=1500w&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I consider Medfield to be typical of suburbia in the greater Boston area, and so what is accomplishable here should be portable to lots of different places in the region. Some solutions will be easier to implement than others, but I think this town is a good yardstick for what the region can get on board with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of solar around me. By that, I mean take a look at a new country-club type place in town that the town is generating energy off of. It&rsquo;s been installed for over a year and the combo of solar power and batteries has really brought down costs in Medfield.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59552faaff7c50fb8b38c931/15436b60-9522-41a7-921a-2de429bd3826/DJI_0868.JPG?format=1500w" alt="image"></p>
<p>I consider Medfield to be typical of suburbia in the greater Boston area, and so what is accomplishable here should be portable to lots of different places in the region. Some solutions will be easier to implement than others, but I think this town is a good yardstick for what the region can get on board with.</p>
<p>The region needs to get on board more - not just from a &ldquo;Save the Earth&rdquo; perspective, but from the real practicalities of Solar power. The sun shines everywhere, all day, and once you get that panel installed it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before it pays itself off. And then you are using the sun to power your car, or your AC, or anything else. It&rsquo;s a powerful idea - and we need to embrace it here.</p>

      <title>Starting a blog</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since March 2020 I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to journal about life, and the past five and a half years have just been full of reasons why a journal of these times is so important.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But why the name? I&amp;rsquo;m really excited by what is going on in electrification, specifically with solar panels taking off in a huge way over the past two to three years. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping this planet&amp;rsquo;s journey to a more solar powered future is a prominent theme to this blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Since March 2020 I&rsquo;ve wanted to journal about life, and the past five and a half years have just been full of reasons why a journal of these times is so important.</p>
<p>But why the name? I&rsquo;m really excited by what is going on in electrification, specifically with solar panels taking off in a huge way over the past two to three years. I&rsquo;m hoping this planet&rsquo;s journey to a more solar powered future is a prominent theme to this blog.</p>
<p>This is short and sweet, but it&rsquo;s the start - I&rsquo;ll take to you(?) in a bit.</p>
