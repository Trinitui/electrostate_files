There&rsquo;s a lot of solar around me. By that, I mean take a look at a new country-club type place in town that the town is generating energy off of. It&rsquo;s been installed for over a year and the combo of solar power and batteries has really brought down costs in Medfield.

I consider Medfield to be typical of suburbia in the greater Boston area, and so what is accomplishable here should be portable to lots of different places in the region. Some solutions will be easier to implement than others, but I think this town is a good yardstick for what the region can get on board with." />

<p>The region needs to get on board more - not just from a &ldquo;Save the Earth&rdquo; perspective, but from the real practicalities of Solar power. The sun shines everywhere, all day, and once you get that panel installed it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before it pays itself off. And then you are using the sun to power your car, or your AC, or anything else. It&rsquo;s a powerful idea - and we need to embrace it here.</p>
