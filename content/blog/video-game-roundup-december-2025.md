# Video Game Roundup

Here's a view of the games I've been playing recently.

### KOTOR 2

I mainlined this game in early december. Beat it in a week. It's a weird, broken thing - but fun! Playing it again.

### KOTOR 1

After failing to get into it in 2024, I've become addicted this month. Playing on Switch. Beat it before the end of the month, and boy does the light side ending just not hit right. That whole game is/can be deeper than it lets on.

### Stonks 9800

Got really into this, and now I'm very rich in game! But now it's the '90s and the economy sucks, so I tihnk I'll stop playing until 1.0 hits.

### Mars Horizon 1

Kinda turn based, space agency style game - fun. Want to put more time into it.

### Nuclear Throne???

The GOAT has returned, and more powerful than ever. Nuclear Throne is such an iconic 2010's indie game, glad it got update 100 and there is a bit more buzz around it.

### Battlefront Classic Collection

Flawed but playing on Switch. Kinda cool to be playing these games on a console again, they work much better with a controller. I'll futz with it for a while, I'm sure.
