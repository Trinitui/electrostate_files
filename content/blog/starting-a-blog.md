## Why?

Since March 2020 I've wanted to journal about life, and the past five and a half years have just been full of reasons why a journal of these times is so important. 

But why the name? I'm really excited by what is going on in electrification, specifically with solar panels taking off in a huge way over the past two to three years. I'm hoping this planet's journey to a more solar powered future is a prominent theme to this blog. 

This is short and sweet, but it's the start - I'll take to you(?) in a bit.
