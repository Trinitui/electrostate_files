# Podcast Roundup

A quick overview of what I'm listening to

### Hardcore Gaming 101's Top 47k games

I've been listening to this one for maybe almost six months? It's a good show for commuting, and I always like hearing people explain why they are passionate about different games. It's rare that a game that came out in the past 10 years is covered, so it's good to hear about obscure games and their stories.

### Side Story

Austin Walker's new pod. About games. He's a great personality and hearing him talk about games again is great. I don't listen religously, but when it pops up in my feed and I have time, I listen in. It's chill, and they talk about games that I don't usually play, so it's a great time.

### A More Civilized Age

This pod was my entry drug back into podcasts. I listen to podcasts all the time because of this show - finding it in 2023 was like discovering a whole new world. Their current unit on KOTOR II I'm not really feeling - I should have played the game alongside them but didn't - but I'll dip in more in the future when their unit changes. Excited to see what comes next from this show.

### Tapcaf Transmissions

I don't listen to new ep's, but I do listen to their older shows on EU Star War books when I finish those books. They aren't the best at recapping books, but it's still entertaining.
