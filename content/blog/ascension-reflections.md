# Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer (2010 - 2021)

This is my favorite deckbuilding game . It's insipired by Magic (a bit) but every card you can obtain is contained in the deck the game gives you. It's a great system, since the decks you make are up to the cards that show up during the game.

### Expansions

This seems like an expensive game to keep up with physically. There's many expansions, and each can be played either independently or all together - but we're talking like hundreds of dollars of investment to keep up with. That's why the mobile/PC/Mac game is so great - you don't need to pay for all the expansions. 

My current favorite expansion? 

- Realms Unchained

My current favorite faction?

- Mechana (for those easy wins).


#### Notes:
- Chronicle of the Godslayer (Set 1) and Return of the Fallen (Set 2) formed Block 1
- Storm of Souls (Set 3) and Immortal Heroes (Set 4) formed Block 2
- Rise of Vigil (Set 5) and Darkness Unleashed (Set 6) formed Block 3
