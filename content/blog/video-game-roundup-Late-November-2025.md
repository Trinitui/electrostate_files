# Video Game Roundup

Here's a view of the games I've been playing recently. 

### Europa Universalis V

They finally made a decent followup to Vicky 2, and put it in a nearly over-designed game. Love it, love playing it, love not know what the heck is going on, and love that these are the early days and more content is coming. This is a wonderful game on it's own, and a fantastic foundation for future content. 

It's also worth noting that they answered the question of "What could you possibly do after 12 years of EU4 and it's updates" with a pretty amazing response - take the bones of EU4 but make it a deeper simulation, and in so doing add mechanics and features that alow the game to grow laterally. Pretty clever stuff. BUT - I wonder how much longer Paradox can keep this up?

### Wall World 2

Games like this are awesome to find. You need to play so many subpar or just ok games to find the indie game like this that really hits in a unique way. 

On it's surface, it's a dome keeper clone, but that comparison only goes so far. There's a story, there's story missions, and a more meaningful upgrade path than dome keeper has. This is yet another hit for the "games with yellow as an accent color" category in 2025 (after Citizen Sleeper 2).  

### Coal LLC

What if indie games were just flash games???

### OpenTTD

I've been fooling around with different scenarios and ideas, but nothing has really caught me at this point. 

### OpenFront.io

In my mind this is a flash game, even though it really isn't. This is a flash game take on Risk, it's fun and arcadey and hits a weird """strategy""" game itch that you need sometimes. Sometime you just need a trashy game to spend time with, and this has been that.

### Battlefield 6

Been playing this on and off, but it can be hard to find time to devote to this with so much otehr good stuff out there
