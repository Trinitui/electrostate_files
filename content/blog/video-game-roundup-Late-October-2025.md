# Video Game Roundup

Here's a view of the games I've been playing recently. 

### Battlefield 6

I try to dip into this when I can. While I'm not happy with the state of AAA games, my one exception is the Battlefield series. I've been hooked since I played 3 back in 2013 and though I haven't played all since that released, I've tried to dip in when I can. I think 2042 ended up in a cool place when I re-visited it this year, and 6 is legitimately good. Excited to play more.

### Ascension Deckbuilding Game

Ascension used to be me and my friend's go-to game back in College. Now, I'm having a ton of fun playing it digitally. While I want to play with other people, I haven't really found a group that wants to play it as much as I do. For now, this version of it is enough.

### OpenTTD

I'm back on it again. I feel like when I finally got into this game late last year some unholy seal had been breached and my life would never be the same again. Like when you play Minecraft for the first time. I'm high on the scenarios this time - playing a Middle Earth one (very cool) and one based on MA (even cooler) and I'm having a blast.


#### Dipping into

1) Mars Logisitcs - this is a fun lego-type game that I need to put more time into
2) Anno 1800 - What a beautiful, overwrought thing they created here. I need to simultaneously play Victoria 3 and sip London Fog tea. 

#### Looking ahead

1) EU5...
