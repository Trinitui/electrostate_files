## Jock Jams

![The Final Installment](/content/images/Jock_Jams_6.jpg)


Jock Jams are the iconic, blasting anthems that were developed throughout the 90's for use primarily at sports games. Or, at least that's where they were played. These are the sorts of loud yet somewhat ambient music that you head from the Jumbotron as you get another beer in between periods. By their very ubiqity, they so easily evade notice.

However, they have surfaced here and there in pop culture, though unfortunately since the turn of the millenium these types of anthems have been coming out less and less.

But - I think they are cool. They are works created with such narrow focus that they do deserve to be understood. I've spent around a decade (embarassing admission) learning about these anthems and codifying them. Early on I decided that they needed to be understood as the Catholic Church understands its' materials: by creating a canon ranking of them.

The Church was smart to do this - there were so many stories about Jesus around where he could do just about anything, and that estabilishing a way of categorizing the "truth" of the stories was their only way forward. Not to exaggerate, but I had the **same** problem when I first decided to understand this genre.

Or, rather, I stumbled into the problem when I realized that ESPN made several albums specifically called ["Jock Jams"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jock_series#Jock_Jams) and this wasn't just some cultural name for these songs.

> "labels wouldn't license their songs to us when the NOW compilations started coming out under a collective revenue-sharing agreement ... It really pissed me off... it felt like an anti-trust thing. How can four labels make a decision to do that?"
